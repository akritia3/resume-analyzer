# Resume Analyzer

## What is the Resume Analyzer and What does it do?

Whether this is because of formatting, typos, lack of experience, or poor wording, it has been a consistent hinder for students to get internships. Therefore, we have decided to create an analyzer that takes in your resume and returns suggestions on how to make it better and more appealing to recruiters. 

Users can:
upload a PDF of their resume through the frontend interface
The backend extracts text data from the PDF, which is then cleaned and normalized
Users can then access parsed information
Users can access an analysis of the effectiveness of their resume based on criteria such as sectioning, keywords, and grammar.
Users receive an overall score based on the ML modelâ€™s evaluation criteria
Users will receive feedback on how to improve their resumes
